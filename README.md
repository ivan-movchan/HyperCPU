HyperCPU is a set of programs created to work with my own simple ISA (instruction set architecture). The project was created for fun, but it took a lot of time (and nerves) and I learned a lot while working on it.

HyperCPU project includes:
* **hCPU emulator**;
* **hASM assembler**;
* ~~**hASM disassembler**~~ (in development).

The project roadmap can be found [here](ROADMAP.md).

### Installation

>[!WARNING]
> HyperCPU supports 64-bit GNU/Linux systems only.

#### Dependencies

* `gcc >= 14` or `clang >= 19`;
* `cmake >= 3.28`;
* `make`;
* `ninja`;
* `re2`;
* `libfmt`;
* `googletest` (required for building tests in Release profile);
* `python3`, `python3-pip`, `python3-sphinx`, `python3-sphinx-rtd-theme` (required for building a documentation).

#### Build instructions

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HyperWinX/HyperCPU --recursive
$ cd HyperCPU
$ cmake -S. -Bbuild -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ ninja -C build default -j$(nproc)
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

`cmake` build options:
* `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING` - project build profile (`Release` or `Debug`), mandatory to be specified;
* `HCPU_SANITIZERS_ENABLED:BOOL` - HyperCPU sanitizers, enabled by default (use `-DHCPU_SANITIZERS_ENABLED:BOOL=OFF` to disable).

The compiled binaries should be located in `build` directory. The generated documentation should be located in `docs/_build/html` directory. Open `index.html` and start reading.

### Usage

#### `hcasm` (hASM assembler)

To compile a program to a binary file:

```bash
$ ./hcasm -o <target> <source>
```

To compile a program to an object file:

```bash
$ ./hcasm -c <target> <source>
```

To do things with a different verbosity level (`warning` by default):

```bash
$ ./hcasm -v [debug | info | warning | error] ...
```

To display a help message and exit:

```bash
$ ./hcasm -h # = ./hcasm --help
```

To display a version and exit:

```bash
$ ./hcasm --version
```

#### `hcemul` (hCPU emulator)

To run a binary:

```bash
$ ./hcasm <target>
```

To do things with a different verbosity level (`debug` by default):

```bash
$ ./hcemul -v [debug | info | warning | error] ...
```

To display a help message and exit:

```bash
$ ./hcemul -h # = ./hcemul --help
```

To display a version and exit:

```bash
$ ./hcemul --version
```
